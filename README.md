# Localize

We believe that everybody should be able to use software in their own language.

Localize takes care of all the background work. You can concentrate on great apps and perfect translations.

Invite staff members to collaborate with assigned roles, let users contribute and export translations in seconds.

> If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.
